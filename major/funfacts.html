                    Shakespearean Inspiration: The film is loosely based on William Shakespeare's classic comedy
                     <b>Much Ado About Nothing.</b>  Sharp-tongued dialogue, witty banter, and a focus on mistaken identities are all reminiscent of Shakespeare's play.

                    Spider-Bite Surprise: During filming in Australia, actress Sydney Sweeney (who plays Bea) was bitten by a spider. The incident was caught on camera and even made it online. Thankfully, it wasn't serious
                     and just added to the lighthearted chaos on set.

                Hidden Tributes: The names of the main characters, Beatrice (Bea) and Ben, are subtle nods to the leads in <b>Much Ado About Nothing</b> - Beatrice and Benedick.  Additionally, the bakery where Bea 
                and Ben get their wedding cake is named <b>Dogberry's,</b> a reference to a character from the Shakespearean play.

                    Box Office Bonanza:  Anyone But You was a surprise hit at the box office, becoming the first
                     romantic comedy to break the $200 million mark since 2018.
